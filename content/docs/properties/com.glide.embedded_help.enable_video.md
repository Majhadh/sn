Description: Shows or hides a video contained in a help topic. If true, the video shows in the embedded help pane. If false, the video is hidden in the pane, but not removed from the help topic.
			Note: All videos must be wrapped in a "class=video" style to disable videos from rendering in the help panel. The client may cache the property.
