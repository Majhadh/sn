Description: <b>Host name case:</b> If "Lower case" is selected, always translate the host name into lower case; if "Upper case" is selected, always translate the host name to upper case; if "No change" is selected, leave the host name intact. This primarily affects host names discovered with NETBIOS, though some non-standard DNS systems may also return some or all of the name in upper case.


Value: `Lower case`
