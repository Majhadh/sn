Description: <b>Physical interface types:</b> A comma-separated list of interface types that will be considered "physical" for the purposes of network discovery.  In other words, if a router (or device capable of routing) has an interface of this type, the networks connected to that interface will be considered locally connected to that device.  The default interface types include Ethernet, 802.11, and Token Ring types.  Interface type numbers are defined in the SNMP MIB-2, specifically in OID 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3.
